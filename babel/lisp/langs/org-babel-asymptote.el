;;; Commentary:

;; Org-Babel support for evaluating asymptote source code.
;;
;; This differs from most standard languages in that
;;
;; 1) there is no such thing as a "session" in asymptote
;;
;; 2) we are generally only going to return results of type "file"
;;
;; 3) we are adding the "file" and "cmdline" header arguments
;;
;; 4) there are no variables (at least for now)

;;; Requirements:

;; - The asymptote program :: http://asymptote.sourceforge.net/
;;
;; - asy-mode :: Major mode for editing asymptote files

;;; Code:
(require 'org-babel)

(org-babel-add-interpreter "asymptote")

(add-to-list 'org-babel-tangle-langs '("asymptote" "asymptote"))

(defvar org-babel-default-header-args:asymptote '((:results . "file") (:exports . "results"))
  "Default arguments to use when evaluating a asymptote source block.")

(defun org-babel-execute:asymptote (body params)
  "Execute a block of Asymptote code with org-babel.  This function is
called by `org-babel-execute-src-block'."
  (message "executing Asymptote source code block")
  (let* ((result-params (split-string (or (cdr (assoc :results params)) "")))
         (out-file (cdr (assoc :file params)))
         (format (or (and (string-match ".+\\.\\(.+\\)" out-file)
                          (match-string 1 out-file))
                     "pdf"))
         (cmdline (cdr (assoc :cmdline params)))
         (in-file (make-temp-file "org-babel-asymptote")))
    (with-temp-file in-file (insert body))
    (message (concat "asy -globalwrite -f " format " -o " out-file " " cmdline " " in-file))
    (shell-command (concat "asy -globalwrite -f " format " -o " out-file " " cmdline " " in-file))
    out-file))

(defun org-babel-prep-session:asymptote (session params)
  (error "Asymptote does not support sessions"))

(provide 'org-babel-asymptote)
